# Line Art Paint

Line Art Paint is a tool that allows you to color images using special strokes called scribbles. These scribbles provide hints to the tool about which regions to fill with specific colors. The scribbles are kept in a separate layer, giving you the flexibility to modify them as needed.

## Features

- Color images by drawing scribbles to indicate regions to fill.
- Scribbles are stored in a separate layer for easy modification.
- Create initial background (BG) scribbles or draw your own.
- BG scribbles can be used to create transparent areas and reveal underlying layers.
- Overdrawing and imprecise placement of scribbles are acceptable.
- LazyBrush spreads color under line art, resulting in smooth blending with soft outlines.
- No color leaks through gaps; no gap closing or parameter tuning needed.
- Refine results by adding or erasing scribbles.
- Multiple scribbles in a region result in the dominant color prevailing.

## Usage

1. Draw scribbles to indicate color regions.
2. **Line Art Paint** fills regions under the line art.
3. Refine results with additional scribbles.
